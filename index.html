<h2>Here’s what it says</h2>

<p>Last Tuesday, the Trump administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-excluding-illegal-aliens-apportionment-base-following-2020-census">issued a memorandum</a> directing the U.S. Secretary of Commerce to exclude all ‘illegal aliens’ from the Census apportionment base. Many experts believe this memo is in direct violation of the 14th amendment, and perhaps a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).</p>

<p>The President uses the term ‘illegal aliens&#39; in both the memorandum and more colloquial, but we, like many others, instead refer to this population as undocumented. <footnote>Undocumented immigrants is the term many have given this community. It refers to those who do not hold a visa or documentation status. The term undocumented is used to give these individuals more dignity than the President’s term does.</footnote> The president’s memo proposes excluding these undocumented persons illegally residing in the U.S. from apportionment. The text of the memo, though not explicit, seems to distinguish those non-citizens that do not have legal status from other <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2018/08/07/dhs-foreigners-overstayed-visas-2017/924316002/">immigrant non-citizen populations</a>: those from countries with designated Temporary Protected Status (TPS), Deferred for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients or Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) residing in the United States. People in the United States illegally may have overstayed their visas or came across the border without any paperwork.</p>

<h2>Process Background</h2>

<p>Every ten years, the Census (under the direction of the Commerce Department) is conducted to determine the populations of the states. Shifts in population over the decade due to internal and external migration as well as changes in birth and death necessitate re-allocating representatives in the U.S. House to provide for proportional representation. As such, each decennial Census captures an updated count of the population. Using the Census enumeration, as required by the Constitution to ensure ‘one person, one vote’ equality (see the series of malapportionment cases beginning in the 1960s with <em>Baker v. Carr</em> ((369 U.S. 186, 1962); see esp. <em>Wesberry v. Sanders</em>, 376 U.S. 1, 1964), the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives are re-distributed according to population size. Every state is guaranteed a minimum of one representative. This also leads to changes in the amount of Electors assigned to each state for presidential elections.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-excluding-illegal-aliens-apportionment-base-following-2020-census">Memorandum on Excluding Illegal Aliens From the Apportionment Base Following the 2020 Census</a></em></p>

<h2>Why it matters</h2>

<p>The U.S. Constitution, as drafted in 1789, requires that Representatives “be apportioned among the several states which may be included within this Union, according to their respective numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons.&#39;&#39; This language, also known as the three-fifths compromise, was very controversial at the time of ratification and was eventually repealed and was replaced in the fourteenth amendment. The ratification of the fourteen amendment in 1868 changed the text to read, “Representatives shall be apportioned among the several states according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each state, excluding Indians not taxed.’”</p>

<p>President Trump&#39;s memo states that as president, Congress has delegated him the right to determine if the Census enumeration is correct before he delivers it to Congress (13 U.S.C. 141(b)). Further, according to Trump, it is “the President’s personal transmittal of the report to Congress&#39;&#39; that &#39;&#39;settles the apportionment.&#39;&#39; </p>

<p>The memorandum main argument is that the Constitution is not explicit about who is to be included as a “persons in each State.” At various times, Trump argues, this has been interpreted to mean those who are regular inhabitants of a state.</p>

<p>He therefore concludes that as president he has been delegated the discretion to determine who is an inhabitant of a state. Using this authority, he has ordered that immigrants who are not in a lawful immigration status be excluded from the apportionment base. He claims this is both appropriate and necessary because those who are in the United States illegally are reducing formal representation for those who are legally here. Implicit in his claim is that as president he has the obligation to enforce the laws of the United States, which include enforcing immigration laws.</p>

<p>This recent memorandum comes just weeks after <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/18/829858289/supreme-court-upholds-daca-in-blow-to-trump-administration">the Supreme Court decided against</a> the administration&#39;s plan to rescind the Deferred for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. DACA, a program instituted under the Obama administration, provides some undocumented people brought to the U.S. as children and who meet certain requirements with work permits and a reprieve from deportation. A 5-4 court majority written by Chief Justice John Roberts in <em>Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the Univ. of California</em> (591 U.S. <strong></strong>) ruled only on the due process of the APA. Justice Thomas wrote a dissenting opinion which argued that the legality of DACA should been evaluated as part of their review.</p>

<p>This week&#39;s memorandum also builds off earlier attempts by the Trump administration to implement drastic changes to the U.S. Census. Back in March of 2018, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross indicated his intent to add a citizenship question to the U.S. Census. This decision triggered a legal battle between the Trump administration and dozens of states, cities, and organizations that filed lawsuits against this decision. </p>

<p><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-019-00803-4">Academic experts warned</a> against the detrimental impacts of adding a citizenship question to the Census due to the drastic population under-counts that adding such question would result in among both documented and non-documented immigrants. The Supreme Court ruled that a citizenship question could not be added to the 2020 U.S. Census because the justification that the government offered at the time for including the question was just a pretext (<em>Department of Commerce v. New York</em>, No. 18–966, 588 U.S. <strong></strong>). Law professor Leah Litman <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/07/22/executive-order-census-immigrants-undocumented/">argues that Trump&#39;s new executive order</a> proves that indeed the census citizenship question was “contrived&#39;&#39; and that the administration never intended to use it to enforce the Voting Rights Act. <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/05/census-memo-supreme-court-conservatives-white-voters-alito.html">Evidence uncovered in the late re-districter Tommy Hofeller&#39;s computer files</a> suggests the same. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Trump administration’s actions and the most recent memo by the President show the continuing strong and harsh anti-immigrant agenda that has characterized it from day one. This includes actions to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/09/politics/trump-legal-immigration-coronavirus/index.html">limit legal immigration</a>, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/02/how-border-apprehensions-ice-arrests-and-deportations-have-changed-under-trump/">demonize illegal immigrants</a>, and<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/trump-brings-atlantic-city-style-bankruptcy-to-americas-immigration-agency/2020/07/03/a4619ff8-bc04-11ea-bdaf-a129f921026f_story.html"> turn legal immigrants into illegal immigrants</a>!</p>

<p>It is important to add that Trump&#39;s most recent memo is not the first time that the consideration of the meaning of the word ‘persons&#39; in the fourteenth amendment for purposes of reapportionment has been questioned. <a href="http://polisci.uci.edu/~jcervas/projects/ocampo/apportionment/DOJmemo1989.jpeg">In a 1989 memo, the Department of Justice</a> offered a legal analysis to the Subcommittee on Government Information and Regulation concerning the constitutionality of proposed legislation to exclude undocumented immigrants from the Census count. Assistant Attorney General Carol Crawford said that “the Constitution require that inhabitants of State who are illegal aliens be included in the census count&#39;&#39;. </p>

<p>More recently, plaintiffs in <em>Evenwel v. Abbott</em> (136 S. Ct. 1120, 2016) argued that by drawing districts that used total population counts for reapportionment diluted their votes. They wished rather to use eligible-voting population as the apportionment base. The Supreme Court rejected the claim that using total population was a violation of ‘one person, one vote&#39;, and that this was was not in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and was consistent with constitutional history, judicial precedent, and state practices of apportionment. However, the court did not determine that a state <strong>must</strong> use total population, but rather that they <strong>may</strong> use total population. </p>

<p>In <em>Burns v. Richardson</em> (384 U.S. 73, 1966), the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Hawaii to draw state legislative districts based on equal numbers of registered voters. The ruling indicated that the Equal Protection Clause does not require the use of total population for substantial population equivalency. </p>

<p>There is currently a pending case in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (<em>Alabama v. U.S. Dept. of Commerce</em>, Case No.: 2:18-cv-00772-RDP) which seeks to have undocumented immigrants excluded from the apportionment counts. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-07/Order_7.21.pdf">An order was filed on July 21, 2020</a> requesting both parties to the case file briefs on the effect of the President&#39;s memorandum. The President’s memo seems to mimic many of the arguments made by the Alabama plaintiffs, and this lawsuit may be the vehicle with which this case is eventually heard in the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

<h2>Potential Effect of Excluding Undocumented Immigrants</h2>

<p>We have investigated the structural effect of the president’s memo. We found that California (two seats), Texas, and New Jersey are all expected to lose representation in the House of Representatives (and Electoral College) if Trump’s proposal is successful. It’s still too early to tell exactly which states will benefit from this change in the apportionment base, but early indicators point to Michigan, Ohio, Idaho, and Alabama as the states which will gain.</p>

<h2>Here’s why most people think it won’t work</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU/status/1285627359094345729?s=20">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/07/21/892340508/with-no-final-say-trump-wants-to-change-who-counts-for-dividing-up-congress-seat">Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and the state attorney general&#39;s offices in New York and California</a> have said they immediately plans to sue. They, along with scores of <a href="https://twitter.com/JoyceWhiteVance/status/1285623928812183553?s=20">academics</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jgeltzer/status/1285719747183751170?s=20">say it</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/_justinlevitt_/status/1285691123483148289?s=20">clearly stated</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/ElectProject/status/1285616071236517889?s=20">the Constitution</a> requires the Census count everyone, including those who are undocumented. Even U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi intends to “vigorously contest&#39;&#39; the order, stating “By seeking to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted in the 2020 census, the president is violating the constitution and the rule of law.&quot;</p>

<p>The Trump administration’s series of recent losses in the U.S. Supreme Court has many believing that this action by the President will likewise fail. In light of these recent legal setbacks, the administration continues to push for policy changes that push the boundaries of legality.</p>

<h3>Not enough time</h3>

<p>The Census has already <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/trump-census-deadline-delays-184273">fallen behind</a> schedule because of delays brought on by COVID-19 shelter-in-place directives. The Census is required by law to provide a tabulation of the total population to the President within 9 months of “Census day,&#39;&#39; which was April 1, 2020 (13 U.S. S141). Under their new schedule, <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/factsheets/2020/dec/2020-census-operational-adjustments-short-version.pdf">delivery of the total population figures is delayed</a> until April 30, 2021. Fears of under-counts have caused <a href="https://us7.campaign-archive.com/?u=1ed63aa66c770d4c2a680227d&amp;id=d77b5bbeb4">legislators in New Jersey</a> to propose delaying redistricting. In anticipation of the delay, <a href="https://www.courts.ca.gov/opinions/documents/S262530.PDF">California has already modified</a> its redistricting timeline. </p>

<h3>Accurate Counts</h3>

<p>Beyond the issue of Census delays, there is also the issue of getting accurate counts of both documented and undocumented immigrants. On July of 2019, after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against his administration&#39;s attempt to add a citizenship question on the 2020 Census, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-collecting-information-citizenship-status-connection-decennial-census/">issued an executive order</a> requiring “all executive departments and agencies (agencies) provide the Department of Commerce the maximum assistance permissible, consistent with law, in determining the number of citizens and non-citizens in the country, including by providing any access that the Department may request to administrative records that may be useful in accomplishing that objective.&#39;&#39; Trump says, “The fact is that we simply do not know how many citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens are living in the United States.&#39;&#39; Trump is correct in this statement, a fact that becomes clear when trying to estimate apportionment given his order. Without the Census citizenship question, good data on this subject is fraught with estimation issues.</p>

<p>But, given the likely delay in Census enumeration, and the feasibility of getting the administrative data Trump has requested, having sufficient data on illegal aliens for the purpose of excluding them from apportionment is problematic. Department of Justice attorney Stephen Enrlich has said that there <a href="https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1285952274410409985?s=20">”may need to be some statistical modeling&#39;&#39;</a> to determine the undocumented population totals for each state since they <a href="https://twitter.com/hansilowang/status/1285952651730071553?s=20">”don&#39;t have all the administrative records yet.&#39;&#39;</a> He added “We haven&#39;t formulated a methodology for how we would do this and things of that nature&#39;&#39;. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the Census could not use statistical methods for the purposes of reapportioning as it violated 13 U.S.C. S195 (<em>Dept. of Commerce v. U.S. House of Representatives</em> 525 U.S. 316, 1999). Moreover, unless Trump is able to positively identify those undocumented persons he intends to exclude as having filled out the Census, he risks illegally undercounting the populations of certain states.</p>

<h2>Here’s why it may work</h2>

<p>The constitutionality of this memo turns on whether the court agrees that the &quot;President, by law, makes the final determination regarding the &#39;whole number of persons in each State&#39;.&quot; To back up this claim, they cite to <em>Franklin v. Massachusetts</em> (505 U.S. 789, 1992): &quot;even after he receives the Secretary&#39;s report, he is not prohibited from instructing the Secretary to reform the census&quot;. The Court may determine that it is the President that &quot;settles the apportionment&quot; (ibid at 799).</p>

<p>Trump administration lawyers seem to have taken more care in drafting this memo than they did for either the Census citizenship question or for the DACA repeal. For instance, they have been careful to show that not only has Congress long delegated to the President the final ability to approve enumeration totals, but to link this lawful authority of the president with his duty to uphold the laws of the United States. They have argued that counting illegal aliens dilutes the formal representation of those legally entitled to it. As the &quot;law &amp; order&quot; president (see Trump&#39;s many tweets on this subject), this policy is consistent with his stated objectives as president. </p>

<p>Roberts, writing for the majority in <em>New York v. U.S. Dept. of Commerce</em> (588 U.S. <strong></strong>, 2019) said that the administration&#39;s justification for the inclusion of the citizenship question as necessary for enforcing the Voting Rights Act was “based on a pretextual rationale” (slip at 2). Likewise in the DACA case, the court ruled that the administration &quot;failed to supply the requisite ‘reasoned analysis&#39; (slip open. At 5). In both cases, not following administrative procedure, not unconstitutionality, resulted in defeat. After an itital <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/chrisgeidner/has-the-trump-administration-stopped-fighting-the-jan-1?utm_term=.it2J41Gl0#.ikAovwrL3">failure to create a travel ban</a> from predominantly muslim countries, the administration <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-proclamation-enhancing-vetting-capabilities-processes-detecting-attempted-entry-united-states-terrorists-public-safety-threats/">issued a new order</a> with an argument based on national security to justify the policy. The court ruled in Trump v. Hawaii (585 U.S. ___, 2018) that "the Government has set forth a sufficient national security justification to survive rational basis review" (slip opin. at 38). The court has shown to give the administration deference if they cure the policy deficiences. This has led at least <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/getting-deja-vu-on-trumps-transgender-ban-youre-not-alone/2018/03/27/4e78091e-312e-11e8-8bdd-cdb33a5eef83_story.html?arc404=true">one commentator</a> and <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/georgetown-law-journal/glj-online/the-supreme-courts-pro-partisanship-turn/">one academic</a> to say the court has engaged in "animus laundering", i.e., accepting minimally revised policies with clear animus towards particular groups with legal justifications.</p>

<p>In this new memo on apportionment, Trump&#39;s lawyers seem to go out of their way to justify the government&#39;s position. They write, &quot;Increasing congressional representation based on the presence of aliens who are not in a lawful immigration status would also create perverse incentives encouraging violations of Federal law.&quot; So, in order to enforce federal law, this order needs to implemented. There is no pretext in that statement.</p>

<p>The Trump lawyers have also questioned the Constitution definition of &quot;persons in each State&quot;, arguing &quot;that requirement has never been understood to include in the apportionment base every individual physically present within a State’s boundaries at the time of the census.&quot; Indeed, they point to overseas personnel as sometimes being included or excluded from apportionment. Moreover, the Census does not include visitors and travelers who are only here temporarily in its counts. </p>

<p>In Executive Order 13880 of July 11, 2019 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-collecting-information-citizenship-status-connection-decennial-census/">(Collecting Information About Citizenship Status in Connection With the Decennial Census)</a>, the President stated the objective of collecting information on citizenship and legal status because of its relevance to apportionment. Executive agencies are ordered to share relevant documents with the Secretary of Commerce. This order has not been overturned by the court.</p>

<h3>Court might split the baby</h3>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court might say that the Secretary of Commerce can not use statistical methods to measure counts of illegal aliens, but may remove from the Census all those they know with certainty to be in the U.S. illegally. But, to do so, the Sec. of Commerce would have to identify an illegal immigrant as someone who has filled out the Census, which might breach the confidentiality of the Census. So, even if the court determines it is constitutional for the President to remove illegal aliens, it might not be practical for them to do so, making the memo moot. This type of compromise is in line with the Chief Justice’s other opinions where he writes narrowly for himself and the four justices appointed by Democratic presidents.</p>

<h2>Here’s the endgame</h2>

<p>Given the low probability of implementing this memo in the 2020 Census, why did Trump issue it? Many people believe that Trump&#39;s push for a citizenship question caused many people to fear responding to the Census, resulting in under-counts of vulnerable populations. Additionally, the Census has reported <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/18/census-bureau-ads-citizenship-question-115718">spent millions combating</a> the citizenship question&#39;s affect.</p>

<p>The Trump administration&#39;s continued efforts to delegitimize immigrants, both legal and illegally in this country, beginning at the start of his campaign, has continued with a series of legal attacks. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664?s=20">Trump tweeted that</a> &quot;I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally&quot;. He created a Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity to review claims of voter fraud, improper registration, and voter suppression, but later dissolved it when it failed to uncover any.</p>

<p>But the real end game for the Trump administration might not be to exclude illegal aliens from apportionment. The political effect of California losing two of its 53 seats is small, especially when the Republican state of Texas is expected to lose one too. Plus, those states that would gain are not clearly Republican strongholds. Rather, the endgame may instead be to force redistricting after the 2020 Census to use as the population base a count that excludes illegal aliens. This would mean a significant shift in representation away from highly diverse, mostly urban areas and into lower-dense, mostly white areas. In <em>Evenwel v. Abbott</em> (578 U.S. <strong></strong> , 2016), the court rejected the argument that the state of Texas was constitutionally required to draw districts with equal numbers of eligible voters. It, however, was silent about whether a different population base could be used for redistricting in the future.</p>

<p>Chief Justice <a href="http://r20.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001algna7jIb2jXCVrh-ChO4Sra2jK1smBn6CrRt1DCII4wgQrOHGDbvUzc0gt_q5WcnUbAp_Koe-j4jFYGnFt7lrgeA4wHRKTG9JDIi60Joeflj9KVLFjsTFEnUGjDZ11YRA08QXpY1SvuGdXIgcMbJk0m0R1t_8350DDFu8HVdtx5XRd03ygPWQ==&amp;c=d33tYsP98U4HpbCo8886g_zuu3lzYlzDB4iGt5XXW0WYpRDjJGzSjQ==&amp;ch=2HuMmL7q5Pce4Yz4LHQLG8oaasxa2x8-mCM_7LLXOYDjvhUDjyHxgQ==">John Roberts is a minimalist</a>. His narrow opinions in both the Census citizenship case and more recently in the DACA case rule that the Trump administration could do those things it sought to do, but they have to follow proper procedures. Moreover, in cases involving election law and voting rights, Roberts has ruled with the liberal justices on technical matters -- but his <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/john-roberts-voting-rights-act-121222">history in the Reagan administration</a>, and specifically his rulings in <em>Shelby County v. Holder </em>(570 U.S. 529, 2013) and in <em>Rucho v. Common Cause </em>(588 U.S. <strong></strong>, 2019) show him to be no champion of Voting Rights. His narrow technical opinions in the Trump series of cases might reflect is incrementalism and long view. He has been chipping away at voting rights for his entire career, and his opinions in Evenwel, the Census citizenship questions case, and DACA (along with others like Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission, 576 U.S. <strong></strong>, 2015) all have room in their opinions that one could drive a truck through.</p>

<p>Even if we suppose that the Trump position in this memorandum has no basis in law and will be rejected by the court, there is still a win for Trump. First, he gets to say that he is doing what he can as president to eliminate what his base sees as a looming problem in America; and he can use scathing rhetoric like &quot;illegal alien&quot; while doing so. And if he loses in court, he creates a second campaign issue on which to run on; stacking the court with more judges who will see the constitution the way he does.</p>
