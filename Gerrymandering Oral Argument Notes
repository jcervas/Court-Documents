JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- "if a state
constitution had a provision that required
redistricting to be based solely on partisan
grounds, forget about whether they -- they were
meeting any other traditional grounds or not,
you would say that was constitutional?"

JUSTICE MR. CLEMENT -- "I think you've put your
finger on what my friends on the other side
perceive to be the problem, which is a lack of
proportional representation."

JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- " all of the tests that they're
proposing and that the district court looked at
didn't talk about proportionate representation.
It looked at only the opportunity to elect.
An opportunity is different. The way
this is structured, there is absolutely no opportunity to -- not none but virtually none
-- I'm exaggerating slightly -- but -- but
virtually none for maybe a majority party to
elect more than or less than a third of the
people they voted for."




MR. CLEMEN -- "it's a
little odd here that we've had all of this
supposedly partisan redistricting to benefit
the composition of Congress, and yet a majority
of Congress thinks that they should pass HR-1."

THIS IS INACCURATELY REPRESENTING THE FACTS SINCE DEMOCRATS WON A LARGE POPULAR VOTE MAJORITY WITH MANY VOTES NOT TRANSLATING TO SEATS.


JUSTICE BREYER AS BERNIE
JUSTICE BREYER -- "Look, my party got a majority of the
votes in the state, but we ended up with less
than a third of the seats. You see, I said --
my tone of voice is meant to be, gee, this is
really extraordinary, but there is absolutely a
workable standard."


CLAIM ABOUT USING ELECTION RESULTS TO PROJECT FUTURE RESULTS
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, but the
one thing that -- I forget where the -- which
brief it is -- but it turns out that a lot of
the predictions in this area, and I don't know
if this applies to North Carolina or not, prove
to be very, very wrong very often.


JUSTICE KAVANAUGH -- "I took
some of your argument in the briefs and the
amicus briefs to be that extreme partisan
gerrymandering is a real problem for our
democracy -- and I'm not going to dispute that
-- and that the Court, even though it might be
a problem to get involved in all these cases,
should, in essence, recognize the emergency
situation from your perspective."


MR. CLEMEN -- "But the framing generation understood
partisan gerrymandering firsthand. James
Madison was the intended target of a partisan
gerrymander by Patrick Henry. He complained
about it bitterly. So did George Washington.
Neither of them contemplated suit. 

Hamilton actually suggested to John
Jay that the Federalists ought to partisanly
gerrymander the electoral college for the 1800
Presidential election. John Jay said it wasn't
such a good idea.

All three authors of the Federalist
Papers knew about this and didn't think there
was a judicial solution."
